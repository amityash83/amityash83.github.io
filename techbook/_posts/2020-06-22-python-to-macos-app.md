# Python to MacOS portable app
### Purpose
This page explains, how to create MacOS portable application with help of python module py2app

### py2app Installation

```
$ pip install -U py2app
```
### Building app
* Need to create setup.py file for project. Go to directory where python script "MyApplication.py" created
```
$ py2applet --make-setup MyApplication.py
```
This will create the file setup.py, which is responsible to tell setuptools how to build your application.

Content of setup.py should be like as follows :

```
"""
This is a setup.py script generated by py2applet
 
Usage:
    python setup.py py2app
"""
 
from setuptools import setup
 
APP = ['MyApplication.py']
DATA_FILES = []
OPTIONS = {'argv_emulation': True}
 
setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
```
